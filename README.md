# Constru 
This project generates a list of images in the “European drawings” department of the museum, and the dominant primary colour for each artwork.</br>
I used the [met museum API](https://metmuseum.github.io/).

# In order to run the code
You should run the next line in cmd (from the proejct's directory): </br>
`npm start`</br>
And then you should wait for the `Server listening on port 3000` message.

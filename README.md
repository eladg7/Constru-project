# Constru 
This project generates a list of images in the “European drawings” department of the museum, and the dominant primary colour for each artwork.
I used the (met museum API)[https://metmuseum.github.io/]

# In order to run the code
You should run the next line in cmd (from the proejct's directory): 
`npm start`
And then you should wait for the `Server listening on port 3000` message.
